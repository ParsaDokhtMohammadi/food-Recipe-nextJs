🍳 Food Recipe App

An interactive recipe browsing application built with Next.js and MongoDB.
Users can explore recipes, filter them by cooking time or difficulty, and view detailed instructions.
This project was one of my first experiences with Next.js, created to practice and demonstrate the use of SSG, SSR, and ISR rendering techniques.

🧩 Features

🍔 Recipe Browser – Browse a list of recipes with images and short summaries

⏱ Filter by Cooking Time – Quickly find recipes that fit your available time

💪 Filter by Difficulty – Choose between easy, medium, or hard recipes

📄 Detailed Recipe Pages – Each recipe includes ingredients, steps, and prep details

⚡ Rendering Techniques – Implemented Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for optimized performance and SEO

💾 MongoDB Integration – Recipe data stored and fetched dynamically from a MongoDB database

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
Backend: MongoDB, Next.js API Routes
Other: SSG / SSR / ISR

🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed to practice real-world Next.js features, including dynamic routing, data fetching, and advanced rendering strategies (SSG, SSR, ISR).
It helped me gain a deeper understanding of how Next.js optimizes performance and improves user experience through different rendering modes.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add recipe creation (admin or user submission)

Include recipe images upload support

Improve filter UI with multi-select and sorting options

Add search functionality
